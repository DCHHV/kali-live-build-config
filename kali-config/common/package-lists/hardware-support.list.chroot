## The b43 firmware require network access, hence are not dependencies of
## kali-linux-firmware. But we install those in the live image anyway,
## since we have network access when we build the live ISO.

## Make sure we install as many input/video drivers as we can. Note that
## these packages need to be explicitly listed if we want to be sure that
## they're installed. Installing xserver-xorg is not enough to make sure,
## due to its dependencies, defined as such:
##  * xserver-xorg-input-all | xorg-driver-input
##  * xserver-xorg-video-all | xorg-driver-video
##
xserver-xorg-input-all
xserver-xorg-video-all
